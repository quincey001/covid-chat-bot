If you routinely check your blood sugar at home, you'll probably need to do it more often – at least every four hours, including during the night.\n \nIf your blood sugar is persistently high or low, or if you have symptoms of a hyper (hyperglycaemia) contact your GP practice or diabetes team by phone who will help you if you have any queries or if you are unsure about what to do regarding your diabetes."

However, the vaccine clinical trials included participants who have other health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, liver disease, lung disease, asthma and HIV. The results of the clinical trials showed that the vaccine is safe for people who have these health problems. Talk with your doctor to know if the COVID-19 vaccine is safe for you.\n\nIf you have a kidney transplant\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials did not get enough data on the safety of the vaccines for people who take immunosuppressive drugs, such as kidney transplant recipients. However, vaccines that do not include a living virus, like the COVID-19 vaccine, are generally safe. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do not include a living virus, so they are expected to be safe for transplant recipients.\n\nIf you have a transplant, ask your nephrologist (kidney doctor) if the COVID-19 vaccine is safe for you."

In some places the rules get relaxed when COVID-19 cases go down and are tightened again when they begin to increase. You should check what the guidance is before deciding to attend an event or to meet other people outdoors.\n\nIn general, the virus spreads more easily indoors than outdoors and so if you have to meet others for essential reasons, it is better to do this outdoors where possible.

Nevertheless, it is important to emphasise that most patients, even those with underlying respiratory disease, have had mild infections and have fully recovered.\n\nAs part of my condition, I regularly have a dry cough and fever – is there a way to distinguish these symptoms with those of COVID-19?\n\nNo. There is nothing unique about the symptoms of COVID-19 and this is why most people who are tested for the virus do not have it. Their cough and fever are actually caused by something else.\n\nIf you have a cough that is typical for you and it has not changed you do not need to do anything differently from normal and do not need to isolate. If your cough changes or you develop new symptoms along with your cough, you should self-isolate and if testing for COVID-19 is available in your country, arrange a COVID-19 test. "

Baricitinib with remdesivir may have a role in patients who cannot receive dexamethasone. Monoclonal monoclonal antibody treatments (bamlanivimab and the combination casirivimab/imdevimab) or convalescent plasma under FDA emergency use authorizations may reduce the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 patients at high risk of complications and mortality, but must be administered within several days of symptom onset, before progression to moderate to severe symptoms or hospitalization for benefit based on trials reported to date. Trials focused specifically on these therapies in SCD patients have not been reported, but consideration of these therapies to limit progression to more serious complications of COVID-19 appear warranted in SCD patients, given their very high risk of severe disease."

    "answer":"If a patient is doing well, there is no reason to change any SCD medications because of the COVID-19 pandemic or actual infection, including recently approved medications such as volexotor and crizanlizumab.\n\nFor patients with symptomatic baseline low hemoglobin levels or patients that are difficult to transfuse because of alloantibodies, voxelotor, a therapy designed to increase the baseline hemoglobin level, can be considered. The decision to begin this agent should be based on the relative benefits versus the risks.\n\nIf COVID-19 rates remain high in your area, to reduce frequency of clinic and pharmacy visits consider telemedicine visits and increasing the supply of medication to 90 days as allowed."

       }
     ],
    "answer":"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has designated SCD among the medical conditions with high risk for severe COVID-19. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) recommends that SCD patients older than age 16 years be vaccinated. The FDA recently extended emergency use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to include adolescents 12 through 15 years of age. Given the high levels of efficacy for vaccines and the low rates of vaccine-related adverse reactions, hematologists should encourage patients with SCD to receive COVID-19 vaccines. Trials studying vaccine efficacy rates in patients with SCD are ongoing. Based on experience with other vaccines, such as the flu vaccines, patients would be expected to respond to COVID-19 vaccines, but potentially with lower antibody titers and/or a shorter period of protection. Trusted providers can play key roles in overcoming vaccine hesitancy, particularly in vulnerable populations. For more information, see the ASH FAQ on COVID-19 vaccination in immunodeficient hematology patients.\n\nIf vaccination with the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (AstraZeneca) or Johnson & Johnson vaccine is considered, clinicians should be aware of the potential for development of venous or arterial thrombosis accompanied by thrombocytopenia 4 to 30 days after vaccination."

    "answer":"Because people with sickle cell disease have an increased risk of developing certain infections, we thought at first that it would be very dangerous. We have been pleasantly surprised. COVID-19 may be one of those infections people with sickle cell disease are not more susceptible to. The only places where COVID-19 has been mortally dangerous for sickle cell patients have been in the Northeast and the crowded urban centers. In Richmond to date, maybe one patient with sickle cell disease has died from COVID-19.\n\nI'm also seeing patients come out in good numbers to get the vaccine. There isn’t the hesitancy among sickle cell patients for COVID vaccination the way there is in other parts of the population. Once again, maybe they think that their immune system can't take COVID-19, so they're more likely to come and get vaccinated and protect themselves. We were very pleasantly surprised."

What we have seen is that people with sickle cell who get COVID-19 have a tendency to present with pneumonia, which is a common complication of sickle cell disease. We’ve also seen instances of blood clotting and other bleeding complications, but more than likely, it's going to be in the form of pneumonia. Fortunately, we can treat pneumonia.

     ],
    "answer":"Yes. Pregnant women can receive COVID-19 vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines offer strong protection against severe illness from COVID-19. If not already vaccinated, pregnant women should have access to WHO EUL-approved vaccines, because COVID-19 during pregnancy puts them at higher risk of becoming severely ill and of giving birth to preterm babies. Increasing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy suggests that the benefits of vaccination during pregnancy outweigh potential risks whenever there is ongoing or anticipated community transmission of the virus. COVID-19 vaccination before or during pregnancy is especially important in settings with moderate to high community transmissionb or for women at higher individual risk of exposure or severe illness."

    "answer":"Numerous studies indicate that pregnant women with COVID-19 are more likely to develop severe illness compared with nonpregnant women (1, 2). This means that pregnant women with COVID-19 are more likely to require hospitalization, intensive care and invasive ventilation to help with breathing. In addition, compared with pregnant women without COVID-19, pregnant women with COVID-19 have an increased risk of preterm birth and of having babies that need neonatal intensive care. They might also have an increased risk of stillbirth and maternal death (1–3).\nAlthough the greater risk for adverse outcomes from COVID-19 applies to all pregnant women, for some women the risk may be even higher. Pregnant women who are older (aged 35 years and above), are overweight (body mass index >30), or have a health condition such as diabetes or hypertension may be at even higher risk of serious outcomes from COVID-19.\n"

Initial vaccine effectiveness studies in countries that have already vaccinated large numbers of pregnant women, primarily with mRNA vaccines, have shown high effectiveness in pregnant women, similar to effectiveness in nonpregnant people (4).\nIn addition, studies have shown that pregnant women who get COVID-19 vaccines develop antibodies that are present in babies' umbilical cord blood (5).

For example:\n• The viral vectors in the AstraZeneca AZD1222 and Janssen Ad26.COV2.S vaccines have been used in vaccines given to pregnant women in HIV and Ebola vaccine trials and in Ebola vaccine deployment programmes, and no significant safety concerns have been observed.\n• The Sinopharm BIBP and Sinovac–CoronaVac vaccines are inactivated vaccines using an adjuvant that is routinely used in many other vaccines (for example, hepatitis B and tetanus vaccines) with a documented favourable safety profile in pregnant women.\nClinical trials in pregnant women are now underway or planned for several COVID-19 vaccines, and monitoring of women who received vaccines during pregnancy, and their babies, is ongoing.\n"

People who are trying to conceive can receive COVID-19 vaccines. A growing body of evidence has not identified any adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines on fertility or the ability to become pregnant. In clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines, and in a large prospective study of couples trying to conceive, rates of becoming pregnant were the same for those receiving COVID-19 vaccines and those not receiving the vaccines (13,14).\nWHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of COVID-19 vaccination, and no pregnancy testing is needed prior to vaccination."

Pregnant women are likely to receive the same level of protection from the vaccines as nonpregnant people.\n• Safety data in pregnancy are increasing and are reassuring: Evidence on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy has been growing. To date, animal studies, monitoring of pregnant women who have received the vaccines, and experience using vaccines with similar components have not identified any pregnancy-specific safety concerns.\n• Some factors make COVID-19 vaccination before or during pregnancy particularly important: The risk of COVID-19 increases in settings with more transmission of the virus. Even in areas with low transmission, certain individuals may still be at high risk of exposure, such as healthcare workers. Pregnant women who are 35 years of age or older, are overweight, or have an underlying health condition may be at even higher risk of serious outcomes if they acquire COVID-19."

However, some things cannot be postponed; in which case it is important to take appropriate precautions to protect yourself and others when seeking medical care."
